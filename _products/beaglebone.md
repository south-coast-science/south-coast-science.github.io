The performance and functionality of the Alpha BB Eng. board is identical to that of the Alpha Pi Eng. Mechanical layout is different, in order to accommodate the BeagleBone headers, connectors and power input.
The Alpha BB Eng. board is compatible with the BeagleBone Cape standards for product indentification, GPIO use, fixing centres and access to camera and display interfaces.
