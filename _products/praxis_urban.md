paragraph: The South Coast Science Praxis offers an out-of-the-box solution for urban air quality monitoring. The Praxis answers both the challenge of capturing accurate data in variable climate conditions and the need for fine grained air quality monitoring networks.

The Praxis offers ultra low noise sensing for gasses (CO, H2S, NO, NO2, O3, SO2, CO2) and particulates (PM1 , PM2.5 and PM10). The device supports multiple analysis techniques including any sampling rate and real time access.

Consistent device function is possible within broad climate range (T/rH) with a casing rated for hostile environments. This includes continuous operation for up to 2 hours in the event of external power loss.

Use Praxis to build a high density air quality network using low-cost, individually baselined devices that use open source device firmware for highly customisable sensing, data delivery and analysis.
