The Alpha Pi Eng. board conditions the analogue output of the AFE and provides digitisation of electrode voltages up to a rate of two samples per second for individual gasses, or one sample persecond for four gasses. In addition, the device can read electrochemical sensor temperature, and atmospheric temperature and humidity.

The board has interfaces for the Alphasense digital NDIR sensor, and current or future OPCs.

An integrated battery holder is provided to enable the electrochemical sensors to remain charged when the device is not powered. The device can therefore perform accurate sampling shortly after start-up.

The Alpha Pi Eng. board is compatible with the Raspberry Pi Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) standard for product identification, GPIO use, fixing centres and access to camera and display interfaces.
