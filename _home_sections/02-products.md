We deliver a range of products that can sample gas concentrations within plus or minus five parts
per billion. Data can then be securely stored, distributed globally to the public or to any other
type of organisation.
South Coast Scienceâ€™s electronics are the result of a working collaboration between ultra-low noise
specialists, electrochemical sensor experts, and environmental scientists.
Each South Coast Science product is adapted to specific use cases, covering internal and external
air
monitoring,
and electrochemical component evaluation.
We offer a modular range of equipment across a grid of gas types, host microcontrollers,
and product deliverables.
